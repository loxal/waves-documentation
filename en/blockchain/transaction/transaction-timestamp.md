# Transaction timestamp

**Transaction timestamp** is a time of signing of transaction prior to sending it to the [blockchain network](/blockchain/blockchain-network.md), specified by the sender.

It is not allowed to set timestamp whose value is more than 2 hours back or 1.5 hours forward of current block timestamp.

The time is specified in _milliseconds_ that have passed since the beginning of the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
